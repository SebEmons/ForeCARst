## Brief summary of the project
Are you also annoyed when you want to calculate the cost of your car, that it is a huge effort to collect everything together from all fuel receipts, bills etc. to taxes and insurance expenses?  Or even worse, do you even know how much you spend on your car? If you have lost track of all your expenses and upcoming expenses or if you need a simple application to replace your confusing Excel list with an extra on calculation of upcoming expenses, then ForeCARst is the right website for you with a once created profile, easy direct input of expenses when they occur and a user-friendly interface we create maximum transparency for todayâ€™s and future expenses.

## Introduction
### What is the idea / background of the project?
Our project aims at the fact that most car drivers do not know how much they spend on their car per month and that they often have difficulties to estimate how the costs for their car will develop in the future. Our application is designed to help users to keep track of their costs for their car and also to make predictions about upcoming repairs, service etc.
Which specific problem should a solution be found for?
The concrete problem which we want to solve with our application is the complexity of the costs of a car, and to make the most predictable costs for car repairs directly visible to the user before they actually occur.

## Methodology
### Which methods / tools from your learning tracks did you use to solve the problem? 
In our team of 3 people, Lara Stahl and Sebastian Emons had chosen the Data Science Track and applied their knowledge of Python programming to the programming of the back end. However, since some areas such as migrating Python code to HTML code were not covered in the track or other applications. So we had to solve this with other sources, therefore we got solutions for this through internet research or asking the mentors. 
Since Leon had chosen the Web Developer Track, he focused on the development of the website and built the website. 
How exactly did you proceed?
At the beginning of the project we identified MVPs and created a schedule for implementation. We divided our work into front end and back end work and had regularly Zoom meetings and discussed problems.
